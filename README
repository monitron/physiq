This needs a lot of work. :)

How to bootstrap from emacs with swank-clojure:

- Run lein deps
- Make sure the working directory is the physiq root
- M-x swank-clojure-project
- In the repl:
    (use 'server 'plan 'helpers)
    (set-plan! (struct plan (today) (day 2010 6 1) 220 180)) ; Sets a plan, since there's no UI for plans yet
    (-main) ; Starts the server
- Visit http://localhost:8080/

How to run as a jar:

lein deps
lein compile
lein uberjar
java -jar physiq-standalone.jar
